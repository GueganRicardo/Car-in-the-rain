# Car in the Rain

## Project Overview

This project was created using OpenGL, with the primary goal of grasping the fundamental concepts of computer graphics.

### Key Learnings

During the development of this project, I gained insights into the following areas:

1. **Projection:** Understanding how to transform 3D scenes into 2D views.
2. **Movement:** Implementing motion for objects within the scene.
3. **Lighting:** Exploring techniques to illuminate the environment.
4. **Materials:** Utilizing different material properties for realistic rendering.
5. **Textures:** Incorporating texture mapping to enhance visual details.

### Project Description

The central theme of this computer graphics project involved a car navigating circular paths around a tree. Here are some specific features:

- **Car Movement:** The car followed circular trajectories, creating a dynamic motion effect.
- **Tree Lighting:** The tree served as a light source, casting shadows and illuminating the scene.
- **Car Headlights:** The car was equipped with headlights, adding realism to its appearance.
- **Rain:** Rain was simulated using small objects that looped their movement from the top to the bottom of the scene.

Overall, this project provided valuable insights into the world of computer graphics and allowed me to apply various techniques to create an engaging visual experience.
